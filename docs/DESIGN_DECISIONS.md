# Design Decisions Log

This document records the reasoning behind significant architectural and engineering choices made during the development of Rustchain.

## Key Decisions

*(For each decision, aim to cover:)*
*   ***Decision Point:*** *(What was the problem or choice?)*
*   ***Alternatives Considered:*** *(e.g., PoW vs PoS, libp2p vs raw sockets, RocksDB vs Sled vs SQLite)*
*   ***Criteria for Decision:*** *(e.g., Security, Simplicity, Performance, Maintainability, Learning Goal)*
*   ***Chosen Alternative & Rationale:*** *(Why was this option selected?)*
*   ***Trade-offs:*** *(What are the known downsides or compromises of this choice?)*

### Example Decision (to be replaced)

*   **Decision Point:** Choice of Consensus Algorithm
*   **Alternatives Considered:** Proof-of-Work (PoW), Proof-of-Authority (PoA), various BFT protocols.
*   **Criteria for Decision:** Learning goal (explore PoS), resource efficiency, alignment with modern L1 trends.
*   **Chosen Alternative & Rationale:** Proof-of-Stake (PoS) was chosen to provide a good learning opportunity, to avoid the high energy consumption of PoW, and because it's a prevalent mechanism in contemporary blockchain designs.
*   **Trade-offs:** PoS can have more complex validator selection and incentive mechanisms compared to simpler PoW. Initial versions might be less secure than battle-tested PoW until slashing and other penalties are robustly implemented.
