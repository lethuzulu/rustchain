## 📈 Optimization Recommendations

### **Production Deployment**

```toml
# Optimized configuration for production

[node]
is_validator = true
data_dir = "/opt/rustchain/data"

[network]
listen_address = "/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/8080"  
max_peers = 50

[mempool]
max_transactions = 2000  # Increase for higher throughput

[logging]
level = "warn"  # Reduce log overhead
```

### **Performance Tuning**

```bash
# System-level optimizations

# Use release builds
cargo build --release

# Set CPU governor
echo performance | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor

# Increase file descriptor limits
ulimit -n 65536

# Use dedicated disk for database
mount /dev/nvme0n1 /opt/rustchain/data -o noatime
```
