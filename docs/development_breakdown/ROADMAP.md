# üõ†Ô∏è RustChain Development Roadmap & Task Breakdown

This document provides an overview of the RustChain development plan.

- For a detailed, sequential phase-by-phase development walkthrough, see [DEVELOPMENT_FLOW.md](./DEVELOPMENT_FLOW.md).
- For task breakdowns specific to each architectural component, see the links below.

## Overall Plan

The development of RustChain is structured to build core functionalities first, then layer on networking, consensus, and other supporting features. The project emphasizes a modular design, with clear interfaces between components.

Refer to [DEVELOPMENT_FLOW.md](./DEVELOPMENT_FLOW.md) for the granular, phased approach. The major component development efforts are captured in the following task lists:

1.  **Core Data Structures & Foundational Logic:**
    *   [Core Data Structures Tasks](./core_data_structures_tasks.md) (Blocks, Transactions, Headers, Merkle Trees, common types)
2.  **CLI Wallet:**
    *   [CLI Wallet Tasks](./cli_wallet_tasks.md) (Key management, transaction signing, CLI commands)
3.  **Transaction Lifecycle & Mempool:**
    *   [Mempool Tasks](./mempool_tasks.md)
4.  **State Machine & Execution:**
    *   [State Machine Tasks](./state_machine_tasks.md) (State definition, transaction application, validation)
5.  **Consensus Engine (Proof-of-Stake):**
    *   [Consensus Engine Tasks](./consensus_engine_tasks.md) (Validator logic, block proposal, fork choice)
6.  **Storage Layer:**
    *   [Storage Layer Tasks](./storage_layer_tasks.md) (Data persistence and retrieval)
7.  **P2P Networking:**
    *   [P2P Networking Tasks](./p2p_networking_tasks.md) (Peer discovery, message gossiping, synchronization)
8.  **Validator Node & Integration:**
    *   [Validator Node Tasks](./validator_node_tasks.md) (Node setup, component integration, configuration, Genesis)
9.  **Testing & Hardening:**
    *   (Tasks for testing are integrated within each component's task file and also covered in the later stages of the [DEVELOPMENT_FLOW.md](./DEVELOPMENT_FLOW.md))
10. **Block Explorer (Optional):**
    *   [Block Explorer Tasks](./block_explorer_tasks.md)

Each component task file will be updated to include detailed, actionable development tasks, dependencies, suggested Rust crates/tools, and relevant milestones derived from the [DEVELOPMENT_FLOW.md](./DEVELOPMENT_FLOW.md).
