# ðŸš€ Finalization: Polish & Publish Tasks

**Owner:** TBD (Project Lead / Team)
**Status:** To Do (Final Phase)

**Relevant Development Flow Phases:**
- [Final Phase: Polish & Publish](../../docs/development_breakdown/DEVELOPMENT_FLOW.md#final-phase-polish--publish)

This document lists tasks for finalizing the RustChain project for showcase and potential wider use.

## I. Documentation & Presentation

- [ ] **Record demo video.** (DEVELOPMENT_FLOW.md Final Phase)
    - Showcase key functionalities: node startup, wallet operations, transaction propagation, block production, basic sync, block explorer usage.
    - Keep it concise and informative.
- [ ] **Write detailed `README.md`.** (DEVELOPMENT_FLOW.md Final Phase)
    - Ensure the main project `README.md` is comprehensive and up-to-date.
    - **List features and usage instructions.** (DEVELOPMENT_FLOW.md Final Phase)
        - How to build the node and CLI wallet.
        - How to configure and run a local testnet.
        - How to use the CLI wallet (generate keys, send transactions).
        - How to use the block explorer CLI.
    - Include sections on: project goals, architecture overview (link to `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md`), current status, known limitations, future improvements, contributing guidelines (if applicable).
- [ ] Review and polish all documentation in the `docs/` directory for clarity, consistency, and completeness.
- [ ] Ensure all diagrams and code snippets in documentation are accurate.

## II. Code Polish & Cleanup

- [ ] Perform a final code review pass for all major components.
    - Check for clarity, consistency, and adherence to Rust best practices.
    - Remove any dead code, commented-out experiments, or unnecessary TODOs.
    - Ensure error handling is robust and user-friendly where applicable.
- [ ] Run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` and address issues.
- [ ] Verify that all tests (unit, integration) pass reliably.
- [ ] Check for any sensitive information (e.g., hardcoded private keys in examples by mistake) and remove.

## III. Publishing & Showcase

- [ ] **Push to GitHub (or chosen platform).** (DEVELOPMENT_FLOW.md Final Phase)
    - Ensure the repository is clean, with a good commit history (squash/rebase if necessary for clarity before a major push).
    - Add appropriate license file (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0).
    - Create release tags if applicable.
- [ ] (Optional) Write a blog post or article announcing the project or a significant milestone.
- [ ] (Optional) Prepare a presentation slide deck for showcasing the project.

## IV. Post-Release (Considerations)

- [ ] Plan for bug fixing and maintenance if the project is intended for ongoing use.
- [ ] Outline potential future features or a V2 roadmap if applicable.
