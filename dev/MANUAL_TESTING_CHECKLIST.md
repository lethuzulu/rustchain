# 🛠️ Phase 13: Manual Testing & Hardening Checklist

This document tracks the progress of manual testing for RustChain's Phase 13 hardening effort.

## Environment Setup

- [ ] **Multi-Node Test Environment**
  - [ ] Set up 3 validator nodes with different configurations
  - [ ] Verify nodes can connect and sync
  - [ ] Test node startup/shutdown sequence
  - [ ] Verify log output is clear and informative

## Invalid Transaction Testing

### 1. Insufficient Balance Scenarios
- [ ] **Test insufficient balance transactions**
  - [ ] Send amount > available balance
  - [ ] Verify transaction is rejected by mempool
  - [ ] Verify clear error message is logged
  - [ ] Verify balance remains unchanged

### 2. Invalid Nonce Scenarios  
- [ ] **Test nonce validation**
  - [ ] Send transaction with nonce too low (replay attack)
  - [ ] Send transaction with nonce too high (future nonce)
  - [ ] Send transaction with correct nonce
  - [ ] Verify nonce increments properly after valid transaction

### 3. Invalid Signature Scenarios
- [ ] **Test signature validation**
  - [ ] Send transaction with completely invalid signature
  - [ ] Send transaction signed by wrong private key
  - [ ] Send transaction with tampered signature bytes
  - [ ] Verify all are rejected with appropriate errors

### 4. Malformed Transaction Data
- [ ] **Test transaction format validation**
  - [ ] Send transaction with invalid serialization
  - [ ] Send transaction with missing fields
  - [ ] Send transaction with extra/unknown fields
  - [ ] Verify graceful handling of malformed data

### 5. Edge Case Addresses
- [ ] **Test address handling**
  - [ ] Send to non-existent address (should create account)
  - [ ] Send to zero address
  - [ ] Send to validator address
  - [ ] Send from/to same address (self-transfer)

## Fork Behavior and Resolution Testing

### 1. Longest Chain Rule
- [ ] **Test fork choice rule**
  - [ ] Create competing chains of different lengths
  - [ ] Verify nodes converge to longest chain
  - [ ] Test tie-breaking scenarios (same length)
  - [ ] Verify state consistency after fork resolution

### 2. Network Partition Simulation
- [ ] **Test network splits**
  - [ ] Start 3 nodes, partition into 2+1
  - [ ] Allow both partitions to produce blocks
  - [ ] Reconnect and observe convergence
  - [ ] Verify no data corruption or inconsistency

### 3. Out-of-Order Block Delivery
- [ ] **Test block ordering**
  - [ ] Simulate blocks arriving out of order
  - [ ] Verify blocks are properly queued/reordered
  - [ ] Test handling of future blocks
  - [ ] Test handling of very old blocks

## Block Production and Validation Edge Cases

### 1. Double Spend Prevention
- [ ] **Test double spending attempts**
  - [ ] Submit conflicting transactions to different nodes
  - [ ] Verify only one transaction gets included
  - [ ] Test mempool handling of conflicting transactions
  - [ ] Verify state remains consistent across nodes

### 2. Invalid Proposer Scenarios
- [ ] **Test proposer validation**
  - [ ] Manually craft block from wrong proposer
  - [ ] Test block from non-validator address
  - [ ] Test block with valid proposer but wrong timestamp
  - [ ] Verify all invalid blocks are rejected

### 3. Invalid Block Signatures
- [ ] **Test block signature validation**
  - [ ] Tamper with block signature before broadcasting
  - [ ] Send block signed by wrong validator key
  - [ ] Send block with missing signature
  - [ ] Verify all are rejected with clear error messages

### 4. Block Size and Transaction Limits
- [ ] **Test block capacity limits**
  - [ ] Create blocks with maximum transactions
  - [ ] Create blocks with no transactions
  - [ ] Test blocks exceeding transaction limits
  - [ ] Verify mempool respects transaction limits

## Node Robustness Testing

### 1. Graceful Shutdown and Restart
- [ ] **Test clean shutdown**
  - [ ] Send SIGTERM to nodes during block production
  - [ ] Verify data is properly persisted
  - [ ] Restart nodes and verify state recovery
  - [ ] Test restart during sync process

### 2. Abrupt Shutdown Handling
- [ ] **Test crash recovery**
  - [ ] Kill nodes with SIGKILL during operations
  - [ ] Verify database integrity after restart
  - [ ] Test recovery during block application
  - [ ] Test recovery during network operations

### 3. Resource Exhaustion
- [ ] **Test resource limits**
  - [ ] Test with very large mempools
  - [ ] Test with many concurrent connections
  - [ ] Test with corrupted database entries
  - [ ] Verify graceful degradation

## Consensus Edge Cases

### 1. Validator Coordination
- [ ] **Test validator behavior**
  - [ ] Test single validator producing multiple blocks
  - [ ] Test validator missing its slot
  - [ ] Test rapid block production
  - [ ] Test block production timing edge cases

### 2. Chain Synchronization
- [ ] **Test sync scenarios**
  - [ ] New node joining active network
  - [ ] Node rejoining after extended downtime
  - [ ] Sync with multiple competing forks
  - [ ] Sync during active block production

## Network and P2P Edge Cases

### 1. Connection Management
- [ ] **Test network resilience**
  - [ ] Test maximum peer connections
  - [ ] Test peer disconnection during sync
  - [ ] Test bootstrap peer failures
  - [ ] Test message broadcasting reliability

### 2. Message Handling
- [ ] **Test message validation**
  - [ ] Send malformed P2P messages
  - [ ] Test message size limits
  - [ ] Test duplicate message handling
  - [ ] Test message replay attacks

## Logging and Error Reporting

### 1. Error Message Quality
- [ ] **Review error messages**
  - [ ] Verify errors are user-friendly
  - [ ] Check error messages provide actionable information
  - [ ] Ensure sensitive information is not logged
  - [ ] Test log levels and filtering

### 2. Performance Monitoring
- [ ] **Monitor system performance**
  - [ ] Check memory usage patterns
  - [ ] Monitor database growth
  - [ ] Check CPU usage during operations
  - [ ] Verify no memory leaks
